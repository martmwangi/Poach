                  <p>Though the numbers of poaching have decreased significantly over the last 3 years, poaching still exist 
                    and its key contributor is corruption and lack of awareness. Lack of awareness of such activities could 
                    equally be summed up to ignorance. Asia have now launched a campaing to help stop demand of animal products
                    in a bid to try to end poaching.
